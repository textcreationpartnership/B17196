            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Apparent Ruine of the <hi>GLASS-MAKERS</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and loss of the said Manufacture, by reason of the Duties laid thereon, most Humbly laid before this Honourable House, in Hopes to prevent the same.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1st,</hi> THE said Manufacture not being capable to bear a Duty, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi>) inasmuch as Glass, before the said Duty, was Sold for much less then 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> And that notwithstanding the said Duty, the Prices of Glass are not Advanced, but the contrary, being now Sold Cheaper then before, and that not for the reason, which Persons Interested in Collecting the said Duties, give out in Speeches for their own Interest, and to continue their Sallary. But for that the Maker endeavouring to sell Glass at such Price, whereby to repay him the Duty already paid his Majesty, hath so lessened the Consumption, that he is forced to sell at any Rate to pay Workmen; and rather than to let his Glass lye longer to grow more out of Fashion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to loose more by it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly,</hi> For this Reason the Maker cannot put himself forward to make any quantity of Glass, in as much as the Duty is payable for all Glass, as soon as the same is made, by which the Maker pays as if the same were free from any Hazard or Danger, but sure to be sold at the Price, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Duty is paid for, when the same is Whole and in Fashion; Whereas 'tis quite contrary, for Glass will unavoidable fly considerable in lying, break in packing in and out; and by lying grow out of Fashion, insomuch, that the Maker would be glad to sell the same for less then it Cost, besides the Duty thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly,</hi> The Trade of Glass-making is not like other Trades, who can have what Workmen they will, and when they will; for Glass-makers being bread up always to the Fire, cannot turn themselves to other things; so that if they cannot be Imployed in their own Trade in <hi>England,</hi> must be forced into Foreign Parts, which have always been ready to entertain any Art from us, and very careful to keep any from us. And to shew how sensible they are of our Workmens necessity to leave their own Countries, have in <hi>Holland, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. Erected Glass-works for their Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by late Advice from <hi>Ireland</hi> it appears, they have laid a great Duty upon all Glass Imported.</p>
            <p>All which being Considered, with the many Reasons already Presented to this Honourable House, 'tis Humbly Hoped will find Relief; that a Manufacture so greatly improved in this Nation, may not be lost; and the Improvers thereof (willing to continue in their Native Countrey) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly the same, greatly doubting as Fugatives, to have such great Care taken of them, as Fugatives have here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Lastly,</hi> 'Tis Humbly Hoped, this Honourable House will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so Improved a Manufacture to be lost, and the Improvers thereof Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when the Duty, the occasion thereof, brings so very little to the Crown, as in several Printed Papers has been laid before this Honourable House, and plainly to be made appear.</p>
